"""
The program receives two natural numbers n and m as inputâ€”the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
Create a mult matrix of size n*m and fill it with the multiplication table using the formula mult[i][j] = i * j.

Input format
The input to the program is two numbers n and m on different lines - the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

Output format
The program should display the multiplication table, devoting exactly 3 characters to the output of each number
(to do this, use the ljust() string method).
